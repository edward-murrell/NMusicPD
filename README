                        NMusicPD library
                        ================
 
        NMusicPD is a CLR-compliant library used for comunicating with a
MusicPD server written in C#.

COMPILING AND INSTALLING
========================

        For compiling NMusicPD, you'll need:
    - A .NET and C# compliant compiler. (Mono >= 1.0 recommended)
    - NAnt for the building process. (go get it on http://nant.sf.net/)

        Go to the toplevel directory, where a file named "NMusicPD.build" is
located, and do:
 $ nant rebuild

        If you're too lazy to get NAnt, you can *try* using build.py, a
simpler builder:
 $ python build.py 

        Then, as root, install the library in the Global Assembly Cache. This
can be done executing:
 # gacutil -i NMusicPD.dll 

   NOTE FOR USERS: You just need this library if you are going to use some
   program that requires it.  If this is your case, you don't need to read
   further.


VERSIONING AND KEY SIGNING
==========================

        Currently the strong name of the library is used just for making GAC
happy.  Don't trust it.  Also, the versioning scheme doesn't follow mpd scheme.


DOCUMENTATION AND API
=====================

        Sorry, for now you'll have to browse the sources.
